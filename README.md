# Demos in C++ by Neel Mehendale
This repository serves as a store of simple demonstrations with comments for most derivations or formula used to help provide clarity and understanding to complex mathematical topics. They are not intended for production use. They are intended for learning key concepts on topics on Cryptography, ML and their base topics.
